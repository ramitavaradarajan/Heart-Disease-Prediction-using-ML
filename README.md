Heart Disease Prediction Project
Introduction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health-related features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant attributes.

Data
The dataset includes features such as:

Age
Sex
Chest pain type (4 values)
Resting blood pressure
Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
Resting electrocardiographic results (values 0, 1, 2)
Maximum heart rate achieved
Exercise-induced angina
ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
Thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect)
